# Contribution Guidelines

This guide is for Developer Catalyst Program participants. We appreciate your efforts in enhancing the Sui ecosystem.

Here's how it works:

- Add your contribution to the README.md under the right section. If there is no fitting section, feel free to make one.
- You can list your name, username, or any identity you wish, or keep it anonymous. 
- Just one contribution for each PR please.
- Make the PR title clear - it should include the contribution name and the Issue number if applicable.

## Issues

You don't have to pick an issue before creating a PR, but it's a good idea. It helps ensure your contribution aligns with what the Sui community needs. Once you start working on an issue, let others know by leaving a comment.

- Check out the [Issues tab](https://github.com/catmcgee/sui-developer-catalysts/issues) for some contribution suggestions made by anyone including the Sui core team.
- If an issue has the `Ready to go` tag, that means the Sui team would love for this Issue to be worked on. 
- Have a unique idea? Go ahead and open a new issue. 

## Submitting a PR

When you're ready to submit, fill out the PR template, which includes:

- Content name
- Content type
- Content link
- Comments about your submission

## Approval Process

We want to keep quality high so here's how approval works:

- After you open a PR, we'll mark it with `In Review`.
- We'll check your content, perhaps ask for changes, and aim to get back to you within 5 days.
- Once your contribution gets the thumbs up, it's merged.

Remember, rewards aren't guaranteed for every contribution, but they might pop up now and then. Thanks for making Sui even better!
