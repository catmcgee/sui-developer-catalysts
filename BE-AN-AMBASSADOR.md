# Welcome to the Sui Developer Beyonder Program

We're delighted to welcome you to the Sui Developer Beyonder Initiative! This initiative aims to unite creative, innovative, and passionate developers into our tech ecosystem. We believe that as a Developer Beyonder, you're uniquely positioned to revolutionize and drive forward the next wave of web3 innovations.

At Sui, we strive for a strong bond with our Developer Beyonders and we will work with you to provide all the necessary support you need. Please feel free to share your unique viewpoints and constructive criticism, as they could help us enhance our initiative and the overall developer community.

In this document we'll give a few guidelines on what we are looking in an Ambassador for this program and what would it look like to become one. 

### What's my mission as a Developer Beyonder? 
**‚ö° Harness your technical powers for the Sui community**

Every Developer Beyonder comes with their own unique technical abilities, and we encourage you to leverage those to augment our community. We're here to facilitate your journey, not to micromanage. You're encouraged to guide educational endeavors, develop technical content, drive community growth, manage events, or contribute however you wish.

### What‚Äôs in it for me?
**‚≠ê Lots of fun things**

The Sui team is all set to reward your efforts! We offer a wide range of benefits that include:
- Co-branding opportunities
- MVP invitations to tech events
- 1-on-1 support from the Sui team
- Priority access to initiatives
- Exclusive swag
- Special Discord roles and badges
- Token incentives on a project basis

##### We‚Äôre always open to hearing your thoughts on other potential rewards.

### How will you track my contributions?
**üî• Show off how you‚Äôve helped the Sui developer community on GitHub**

We believe in recognizing each and every contribution made. Your contributions will be documented in [this](https://github.com/catmcgee/sui-developer-catalysts/tree/main) designated repo.
Please make a PR to include any links in the README.md. We‚Äôll merge into the main branch when reviewed. You can also go take a look at what others have contributed and learn from the community content!
